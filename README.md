# Pandas Data Analysis & Manipulation

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating core functionalities of the **Pandas** library for data science and analysis. It uses a sample sales dataset to showcase real-world data manipulation tasks.

## 🚀 Overview

The project focuses on practical applications of Pandas, specifically:
* **Data Cleaning**: Checking for missing values using `isnull()`.
* **Filtering & Selection**: Extracting specific data based on conditions (e.g., filtering revenue >= 40,000 or specific categories like 'Electronics').
* **Data Transformation**: Updating values in bulk based on row conditions.
* **Advanced Indexing**: Using `.loc` and conditional logic for precise data retrieval.
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing salesperson performance using `value_counts()` and `count()`.

## 📊 Dataset Structure

The analysis is performed on a sales dataset with the following attributes:
- `Order_ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `Date`: Transaction timestamp.
- `Region`: Geographic sales area (North, South, East, West).
- `Category`: Product type (Electronics, Furniture).
- `Salesperson`: Team member responsible for the sale.
- `Quantity`: Number of units sold.
- `Revenue`: Total earnings from the sale.
